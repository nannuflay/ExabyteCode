                      Our journey started in 2021 with co-founders Med & Mehdi, who took a leap of faith and
                      left their regular jobs.
                      <br/> We started with a small  project which then lead to other recommendations and a lot of fun challenges. 
                      <br/> <br/> <p className=" mt-10"> Towards the end of the year, we had our first colleague joining us to help out with a new project and our team had its first growth step from 2 to 3 people.</p>

      "We live the present by serving our new and existing customers, some of them being with us right from our beginning to this day. Our team has reached 17 team members, with 50+ projects being completed and worked on from small to large-scale web apps. We had several internships and social events, attended conferences as speakers, did open source work, and even started our own internal product.",
